Tentative stages of the project

Step 1: Initial Data Analysis

The first step of approach for a tentative overall methodology regarding telecommunications customer churn prediction is an initial data analysis. For initial data analysis, this project will display the information of the dataset to find the types of variables. Moreover, this project will perform finding the mean, median, and standard deviation in this dataset.

Step 2: Data Preparation

The second step of approach for a tentative overall methodology regarding telecommunications customer churn prediction is a data preparation. For data preparation, this project will focus on finding any missing values and outliers in this dataset. It is important to perform data preprocessing including data cleaning before exploratory data analysis because missing values and outliers may affect the results.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

The third step of approach for a tentative overall methodology regarding telecommunications customer churn prediction is an exploratory data analysis. For exploratory data analysis, this project will perform several visualizations including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand the data and to summarize the characteristics of variables for preparing building predictive models and evaluating predictive models. Moreover, this project will also perform types of correlations of variables in this dataset and display a visualization of correlations between variables to compare the results among various types of correlations. This project may use Pearson and Spearman as types of correlation.

Step 4: Building Predictive Models

The fourth step of approach for a tentative overall methodology regarding telecommunications customer churn prediction is building predictive models. This project will perform data normalization first before building predictive models. The techniques that may use for building predictive models are decision trees, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, random forest, and AdaBoost.

Step 5: Evaluating Predictive Models

The last step of approach for a tentative overall methodology regarding telecommunications customer churn prediction is evaluating predictive models. The technique that may use for evaluation of predictive models is confusion matrix to calculate accuracy, precision, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. This project will compare various types of predictive models and see whether these predictive models have been shown the effectiveness to predict telecommunications customer churn.

Data Description

The data used in this project is Telco Customer Churn Dataset. Telco Customer Churn Dataset is originally made by IBM Cognos Analytics. IBM Cognos made a sample data about a fictional telecommunications company’s customer churn based on various factors. The dataset used in this project is Telco Customer Churn Dataset that is updated by BlastChar from Kaggle website. Telco Customer Churn Dataset updated by BlastChar from Kaggle website has 7,043 observations and 21 variables.
